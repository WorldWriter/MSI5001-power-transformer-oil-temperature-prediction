---

## 4. Temporal Feature Engineering and Enhancement

### 4.1 Motivation for Temporal Features

The baseline analysis revealed significant limitations, particularly for longer prediction horizons. This motivated investigation into temporal feature engineering based on several hypotheses:

#### 4.1.1 Seasonal Hypothesis
Oil temperature should exhibit seasonal patterns due to:
- Ambient temperature variations
- Seasonal load patterns
- Cooling system efficiency changes

#### 4.1.2 Diurnal Hypothesis  
Daily temperature cycles should be observable due to:
- Daily load patterns (work hours vs. off hours)
- Diurnal ambient temperature variations
- Thermal inertia effects

#### 4.1.3 Weekly Hypothesis
Weekly patterns should emerge from:
- Weekday vs. weekend load differences
- Industrial vs. residential consumption patterns
- Maintenance scheduling patterns

### 4.2 Temporal Feature Construction

#### 4.2.1 Basic Temporal Features
```python
# Core temporal components
df['hour'] = df.index.hour           # 0-23
df['dayofweek'] = df.index.dayofweek # 0-6 (Monday=0)
df['month'] = df.index.month         # 1-12
df['dayofyear'] = df.index.dayofyear # 1-365
```

#### 4.2.2 Derived Temporal Features
```python
# Seasonal categorization
df['season'] = df['month'].map({12:0, 1:0, 2:0,    # Winter
                                3:1, 4:1, 5:1,     # Spring  
                                6:2, 7:2, 8:2,     # Summer
                                9:3, 10:3, 11:3})  # Autumn

# Work pattern features
df['is_weekend'] = (df['dayofweek'] >= 5).astype(int)
df['is_worktime'] = ((df['hour'] >= 8) & (df['hour'] <= 18) & 
                     (df['dayofweek'] < 5)).astype(int)
```

#### 4.2.3 Cyclical Encoding
To preserve cyclical nature of temporal features:
```python
# Sine-cosine encoding for cyclical features
df['hour_sin'] = np.sin(2 * np.pi * df['hour'] / 24)
df['hour_cos'] = np.cos(2 * np.pi * df['hour'] / 24)
df['month_sin'] = np.sin(2 * np.pi * df['month'] / 12)
df['month_cos'] = np.cos(2 * np.pi * df['month'] / 12)
```

### 4.3 Feature Dimensionality Impact

The introduction of temporal features significantly expanded the feature space:

| Prediction Window | Baseline Features | Enhanced Features | Expansion Factor |
|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| 1-hour | 96 | 272 | 2.83× |
| 1-day | 192 | 544 | 2.83× |
| 1-week | 384 | 1088 | 2.83× |

**Calculation**: Each time step now includes 17 features (6 electrical + 11 temporal) instead of 6 electrical features only.

### 4.4 Enhanced Model Performance Results

#### 4.4.1 Random Forest with Temporal Features

| Prediction Window | Baseline R² | Enhanced R² | R² Improvement | Baseline RMSE | Enhanced RMSE | RMSE Improvement |
|-------------------|-------------|-------------|----------------|---------------|---------------|------------------|
| **1-hour** | -0.092 | 0.117 | **+0.210** | 7.97°C | 7.16°C | **+0.80°C** |
| **1-day** | -0.026 | 0.082 | **+0.108** | 7.79°C | 7.37°C | **+0.42°C** |
| **1-week** | 0.018 | 0.096 | **+0.079** | 8.01°C | 7.68°C | **+0.33°C** |

#### 4.4.2 Ridge Regression with Temporal Features

| Prediction Window | Baseline R² | Enhanced R² | R² Improvement | Baseline RMSE | Enhanced RMSE | RMSE Improvement |
|-------------------|-------------|-------------|----------------|---------------|---------------|------------------|
| **1-hour** | -0.193 | -0.029 | **+0.163** | 8.33°C | 7.73°C | **+0.59°C** |
| **1-day** | -0.120 | -0.033 | **+0.088** | 8.14°C | 7.82°C | **+0.32°C** |
| **1-week** | 0.013 | -0.339 | **-0.352** | 8.03°C | 9.35°C | **-1.32°C** |

## 5. Critical Analysis: The Ridge Regression Anomaly

### 5.1 Anomaly Identification

A significant anomaly emerged in our temporal enhancement analysis: **Ridge regression with temporal features showed severe performance degradation for 1-week predictions**, contrasting sharply with improvements in other configurations.

#### 5.1.1 Anomaly Quantification
- **R² Degradation**: From +0.013 to -0.339 (-0.352 change)
- **RMSE Deterioration**: From 8.03°C to 9.35°C (+1.32°C increase)
- **Relative Impact**: While Random Forest improved by +0.079 R², Ridge degraded by -0.352 R²

### 5.2 Root Cause Analysis

#### 5.2.1 Curse of Dimensionality
**Feature Explosion**: 1-week prediction with temporal features creates 1088-dimensional feature space
```
Feature Dimensions = 64 time steps × 17 features = 1088 dimensions
Training Samples ≈ 8000
Dimension/Sample Ratio = 1088/8000 = 0.136 (critically high)
```

**Overfitting Mechanism**: High-dimensional space with limited samples leads to:
- Spurious correlations in training data
- Poor generalization to test data
- Unstable coefficient estimates

#### 5.2.2 Linear Model Structural Limitations

**Temporal Feature Complexity**: Time-based features exhibit complex non-linear interactions:
- **Seasonal × Hourly Interactions**: Temperature patterns vary by season and time of day
- **Workday × Load Interactions**: Different load patterns on weekdays vs. weekends
- **Multi-scale Coupling**: Hour, day, week, and seasonal patterns interact non-linearly

**Ridge Regression Constraints**:
- **Linear Assumption**: Cannot capture non-linear temporal interactions
- **Fixed Regularization**: α=1.0 insufficient for 1088-dimensional space
- **Feature Weight Distribution**: Regularization spreads weights across irrelevant features

#### 5.2.3 Signal-to-Noise Degradation

**Prediction Horizon Effects**:
| Horizon | Signal Strength | Noise Level | Ridge Performance | Explanation |
|---------|----------------|-------------|-------------------|-------------|
| 1-hour | Strong | Low | Improved | Clear temporal patterns |
| 1-day | Medium | Medium | Slight improvement | Some signal degradation |
| 1-week | Weak | High | **Severe degradation** | Signal drowned in noise |

### 5.3 Comparative Analysis: Why Random Forest Succeeded

#### 5.3.1 Random Forest Advantages
| Characteristic | Ridge Regression | Random Forest | Impact |
|----------------|------------------|---------------|---------|
| **Feature Selection** | Uses all features | Random feature subsets | Reduces dimensionality curse |
| **Non-linearity** | Linear combinations only | Tree-based splits | Captures complex patterns |
| **Regularization** | L2 penalty | Ensemble + pruning | Adaptive overfitting control |
| **Robustness** | Sensitive to outliers | Ensemble averaging | Improved stability |

#### 5.3.2 Empirical Evidence
**1-week Prediction Comparison**:
- **Random Forest**: R² 0.018 → 0.096 (+0.079 improvement)
- **Ridge Regression**: R² 0.013 → -0.339 (-0.352 degradation)
- **Performance Gap**: 0.431 R² units difference

### 5.4 Implications for Model Selection

#### 5.4.1 Risk Assessment Matrix
| Model Type | Short-term Risk | Medium-term Risk | Long-term Risk | Overall Rating |
|------------|----------------|------------------|----------------|----------------|
| Random Forest + Temporal | 🟢 Low | 🟢 Low | 🟢 Low | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Ridge + Temporal | 🟡 Medium | 🟠 High | 🔴 Critical | ⭐⭐ |
| Baseline Models | 🟢 Low | 🟢 Low | 🟢 Low | ⭐⭐⭐ |

Complex interactions between temporal scales:
- **Season × Hour**: Different daily patterns in summer vs. winter
