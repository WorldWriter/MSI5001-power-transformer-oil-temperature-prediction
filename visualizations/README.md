# Visualizations Directory

This directory contains all visualizations generated for the oil temperature prediction analysis project. All charts use English text for better accessibility and understanding.

## Directory Structure

### `/temporal_impact/`
Contains visualizations specifically focused on analyzing the impact of temporal features on prediction accuracy.

#### Files:
1. **`performance_comparison.png`** - Comprehensive Performance Analysis
   - **Content**: Four-panel comparison showing R² scores, RMSE values, performance improvements, and feature dimension expansion
   - **Models**: RandomForest and Ridge regression across 1H, 1D, and 1W prediction windows
   - **Key Insights**: 
     - RandomForest shows consistent improvements across all time windows
     - Best improvement: +0.2095 R² for RandomForest 1H prediction
     - Feature dimensions expanded by 2.83× with temporal features

2. **`temporal_patterns.png`** - Temporal Pattern Analysis
   - **Content**: Four-panel analysis of seasonal, daily, weekly patterns and feature correlations
   - **Key Findings**:
     - Annual temperature range: 63.1°C (5°C winter low to 38°C summer peak)
     - Daily peak at 22:00, valley at 6:00
     - Workday vs weekend temperature difference: ~2.4°C
     - Strongest correlations: dayofyear (0.1730), month (0.1749)

3. **`performance_summary.png`** - Overall Impact Summary

## Chart Interpretation Guide

### Performance Metrics
- **R² Score**: Higher values indicate better model performance (closer to 1.0 is better)
- **RMSE**: Lower values indicate better accuracy (measured in °C)
- **Improvement**: Positive values indicate performance gains with temporal features

### Color Coding
- **Green**: Positive improvements, successful configurations
- **Red**: Performance degradation, unsuccessful configurations  
- **Blue/Orange**: Baseline vs enhanced model comparisons
- **Seasonal colors**: Intuitive mapping (orange for temperature, green for growth patterns)

### Statistical Significance
- All improvements shown are based on actual model performance data
- Baseline models use only historical temperature data
- Enhanced models include comprehensive temporal feature engineering

## Data Sources
- **Time Feature Comparison**: `results/time_features/time_feature_comparison_results.csv`
- **Seasonal Analysis**: `results/seasonal_analysis/seasonal_analysis_results.xlsx`
